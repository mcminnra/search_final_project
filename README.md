## Task 1
Multi-Label Text Classification

Done:
- [X] Each Review apply categories + business name
- [X] Train on reviews to learn multi-label categories
- [X] then from real world reviews about a business with no categories, you can suggest some. 
- [X] Maybe look into Embedding then CNN/LSTM
- [X] add title to text

Todo:
- is there a better metric than accuracy?
- Make Preds on val (or at least some subset)
- Maybe add tips?
- Maybe switch to lemmization?
- look at better neural network structure
- Maybe look into batches for training data
- glove word embedding?
- N-Gram features?

## Task 2
Deep Matrix Factorization
